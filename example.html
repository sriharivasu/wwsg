        And that JavaScript is working too!
        And that I know how to code!
        And an example for the actual coding. Without CSS it is the first half. With CSS, it is part of the second half: Knowing CSS.
        The second half of the CSS part is making it look good, which is not what this is.
        But JS is not needed.
